# Sharks-and-moon-phases
### ðŸ¦ˆðŸŒ‘ Investigated the correlation between shark attacks and different moon phases. I scraped 50 years of moon phase data from the Astronomical Applications Department of the U.S. Naval Observatory and superimposed that onto shark attacks which I retrieved from https://www.sharkattackfile.net/ global shark attacks file. I then aggregated by moon phase and the fatality of the attack.
